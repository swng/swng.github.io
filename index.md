# List of my tetris project sites hosted by github

- [cover-visualizer](/cover-visualizer)  
    Tool for visualizing - in the form of queue lookup - results of [sfinder](https://github.com/knewjade/solution-finder)-generated cover.csv files. Homepage has a short demo with a few pre-included files and option to upload custom file. I've also used it to make custom opener guides (e.g. [an advanced DPC page](https://swng.github.io/cover-visualizer/dpc_4/)) and setup "solvers" (lookup tables) e.g. [Tsar Cannon](https://swng.github.io/cover-visualizer/tsar_cannon/) and [Flattop LST](https://swng.github.io/cover-visualizer/flattop_lst/). Find more [at the repository](https://github.com/swng/cover-visualizer) - each page is in its own folder.
- [fumen](/fumen)  
    Taken from [the original fumen](https://fumen.zui.jp/) for drawing tetris diagrams and rehosted at [fumen.sixwi.de](https://fumen.sixwi.de/) - I've added some QOL features: Grey Out button, Mirror Page button, made dumpstep an editable variable in LocalStorage for more controllable List Views, and made the useful addons load by default ("english.js|onclose.js|greyout.js|mirror.js|listing.js|frame.js|pfcode.js")
- [FumenUtil](/FumenUtil)  
    This is a tool for manipulating fumen codes with specialized tools. Pretty useful when doing research with sfinder with fumen tools. Too much to describe in-depth within a short summary blurb... Note that [Hsterts](https://github.com/hsterts) has forked FumenUtil into [Fumenities](https://hsterts.github.io/Fumenities/) - it looks nicer and has some improvements and added features. There's still 3 or 4 small things I prefer about my original page though...
- [opener_db](/opener_db)  
    A vast library of tetris openers documented and curated by Eyevy and transformed into a searchable database by me.
- [stolen_google_docs](/stolen_google_docs)  
    This was an effort to host google-docs guides on github. I don't enjoy the experience of reading google docs - the page is sluggish and bulky with google analytics tracking js and an edit UI that viewers don't need, there's a blinding light-mode sidebar you can't get rid of, the URL is fully human-unreadable and unSEO-indexable and unsearchable...
- [TETR.IO-emote-list](/TETR.IO-emote-list)  
    Zudo's tetrio-emote-list. Zudo decided to quit from the community and take down all his projects with him so I preserved this. Turns out his quitting ended up lasting like a week...
- [tetriodamcalc](/tetriodamcalc)  
    This is a tool for calculating damage done in tetrio vs S1. And [the S2 Tetra League dam calc page](https://swng.github.io/tetriodamcalc/s2/)
- [ttpc](/ttpc)  
    Hosted the english translated ttpc tutorial (found in [four.lol PCO page references](https://four.lol/perfect-clears/opener#see-also--references)) for learning PCO solutions by category. This was a godsend when I was learning PCO.
- [ttpc_2](/ttpc_2)  
    TTPC but with some QOL changes, faster handling, 180 added, ye
- [ttt](/ttt)  
    Tetris Trainer Tres-Bien - translated to English. Teaches a bunch of useful midgame T-Spin tech, and some useful SRS spins.
- [twowide](/twowide)  
    Twowide puzzle site, originally set up by garbo and nukeexplotions, now maintained by me. Rush mode is defunct now, without a backend server since github pages is just static. Play on [sixwi.de](https://sixwi.de/) or [twowi.de](https://twowi.de/) !!! (Actually has backend server. Puzzles there are actively being maintained and updated and new puzzles and features are being added).
- [ultra_to_blitz](/ultra_to_blitz)  
    Ultra and Blitz are both similar 2 minute game modes where you try to score the most points. But with the blitz level system obfuscating the numbers, how do scores in each mode translate to one another? Use this tool to see how your ultra run would score in blitz.  
    (blitz->ultra converter provided as well but is now defunct since osk changed replay format, I haven't updated it since)
- [zztetris](/zztetris)  
    a tetris client that starts with ZZ so you can type "ZZ" into your address bar and have it autocomplete. Hosted at [zztetris.sixwi.de](https://zztetris.sixwi.de/)  
    Actively maintained practice tool.
- [zztetris_unstable](/zztetris_unstable)  
    um I used this as a fork to test random features. I think the current version showcases "originality" buckets that were present as hidden values in tetrio's 5m blast event.

# List of non-github tetris projects

Github Pages was great for static sites, but some projects involve compute backends.  
I own [sixwi.de](https://sixwi.de/) and put some projects there.

- [SFinder Site](https://sfinder.sixwi.de/)  
    Web tool for using sfinder. Includes board drawing UI some simple input fields, and a button to call the backend sfinder API. Results are visually renders if applicable. Actively being developed. Most commands are PC related. May add more command types in the future.  
    Also available as a discord bot (with more commands). Discord bot is a group project. Best place to get started using the bot might be [the PC Gang discord server](https://discord.gg/HQ3aJM7TJw).
- [sixwi.de](https://sixwi.de/)  
    This is where I'm actively developing the original twowi.de puzle project. Lots of challenging T-Spin puzzles to play here. Compete on the leaderboard! New puzzles are being actively worked on.
- [Least Blocks Cheese Race Leaderboard](https://cheese.sixwi.de/)  
    Originally written by freyhoe, I'm hosting this leaderboard now. Downstacking cheese efficiently is a skill we find valuable, but jstris only has a time-based leaderboard! So we have this third-party resource to track least-blocks as a leaderboard. orz is cool
- [zztetris.sixwi.de](https://zztetris.sixwi.de/) and [fumen.sixwi.de](https://fumen.sixwi.de/)  
    These are open source on github, but I have them here for the convenient URLs.

I have some more private projects that I probably won't share here.
